					  <p>Alright, so like the other people here, I'm pretty shocked at the choices given when you reach the end of that really short survey. I guess I expected some half-eaten sandwich or used dental floss, haha. Boy, was I wrong. You only asked me like a handful of questions and then you let me choose an e-Cigs kit? Looks like I got the far better end of this deal. Thanks for making it so quick and easy!</p>

					  <p>I usually don't do doing surveys, but I thought I'd give this one a shot. I have to say, it was really quick and easy! I mean, within a few minutes and just a few simple questions, you're giving me the option to choose between four unbeatable gifts. I don't know how you do it, but I'm all in! Thanks for the teeth whitener, my teeth look fantastic!</p>

					  <p>When your five question survey popped up I thought there was no way the rewards were actually valued over $100. That's just being honest. But then I got to the end and got to select it and I thought, 'This is the greatest survey in the history of surveys!' Seriously though, I don't know how the data you collect helps you, or how you can afford to offer such great products, but I'm happy to take them off your hands. Let me know if you need another one done!</p>

					  <p>I haven't taken a multiple choice test since college, so when I saw the survey I had some flashbacks to my school days. Thankfully it was only five easy questions. I was genuinely impressed with the offers as well. When I've seen other surveys on ecommerce sites they usually offer trinkets. These are real products.</p>

					  <p>All of the products looked great, but none of them really applied to my current needs. What is a girl to do? Well, I decided to order the eCigs to try and help a friend break her smoking habit. So far, so good.</p>
